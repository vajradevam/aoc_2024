This is a letter to myself and everyone that i tried to do this problem in C but because i am a student of kitt; it is impossible fpr me to do something like this... I did the first problem by regex matching in python; i am too dumbass to do the second one similarly.. ps i dont get paid for this.. if i would have got a payment for solving such problems, i would have considered solving it... My son will learn C programming and solve this problem one day in C99... Later... Peace...
